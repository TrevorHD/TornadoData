# Overview

An exploration of tornadoes in the United States, using 1950-2011 data from the NOAA Storm Events Database. This work is inspired by a project from a data science class a few years ago and is mostly focused on visualising the data.

# Files

## Scripts

**DBQueries** *(.sql)* - SQL queries used to create a table of tornado event data, as well as some additional example queries that are not used in the analyses.

**Tornadoes** *(.R)* - All of the code used to analyse the tornado data. **Note**: because the database is so large, the file for it is not included in this repository. If you would like to know how to get the data, please contact me.

## Figures

**Figure1** *(.jpeg)* - Plots showing data on tornado movement directions. The vast majority of tornadoes move either east or northeast. Local maxima tend to occur at cardinal and intermediate directions, suggesting that movement may be reported at low resolution when more precise movement data cannot be obtained.

**Figure2.1** *(.jpeg)* - Plots of total number of tornadoes, total number of deaths, and mean deaths per tornado for tornadoes scaled on the Fujita scale (F0-F5).

**Figure2.2** *(.jpeg)* - Plots of total number of tornadoes, total number of deaths, and mean deaths per tornado for tornadoes scaled on the enhanced Fujita scale (EF0-EF5).

**Figure3** *(.jpeg)* - Plots showing state-level mean number of tornadoes per year (with and without adjustment for land area, respectively).

**Figure4** *(.jpeg)* - Plots showing county-level mean number of tornadoes per year (with and without adjustment for land area, respectively).

**Figure5** *(.jpeg)* - Plot showing all reported tornado events from 1950-2011, with each dot representing one event.

**Figure6.1** *(.gif)* - Plot showing all reported tornado events from 1950-2011 based on F-scale ranking, with each dot representing one event.

**Figure6.1.X** *(.png)* - Still images used to create the GIF in the previously-listed figure.

**Figure6.2** *(.gif)* - Plot showing all reported tornado events from 1950-2011 based on EF-scale ranking, with each dot representing one event.

**Figure6.2.X** *(.png)* - Still images used to create the GIF in the previously-listed figure.
